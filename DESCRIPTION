Description: A collection of functions for fitting Cox model with a shared
    nonparametric discrete frailty term. These functions should be applied to 
    hierarchical (or grouped) time-to-event data. There are also functions for
    simulating hirarchical time-to-event data with a parametric or nonparametric 
    baseline..
