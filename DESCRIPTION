Description: Functions for fitting Cox proportional hazards models for grouped time-to-event data, where the shared group-specific frailties have a discrete nonparametric distribution.  There are also functions for simulating from these models, and from similar models with a parametric baseline survival function. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.2), survival
